# Hand Gesture-Based Cursor Control and Arithmetic Solver

Welcome to the Hand Gesture-Based Cursor Control and Arithmetic Solver project! 🚀 This project uses hand gestures to control your computer's cursor, input numbers and arithmetic operators, and solve basic mathematical equations.

## Features ✨
- **Cursor Control**: Move the mouse cursor with your hand gestures.
- **Gesture-Based Arithmetic Input**: Input numbers and operators through hand gestures.
- **Equation Solver**: Perform basic arithmetic operations and display the results.
- **Mouse Actions**: Simulate left and right mouse clicks through specific gestures.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing and processing video from the webcam.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For controlling the mouse cursor and simulating clicks.

## Installation 📦

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-calculator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd hand-gesture-calculator
    ```

3. **Install the Required Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Perform Hand Gestures:**
   - **Move Cursor**: Use your index finger to move the cursor on the screen.
   - **Input Numbers**: Show your fingers to input numbers from 0 to 5.
   - **Input Operators**: Use specific gestures to input arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
   - **Click**: Perform a click by bringing your thumb and index finger close together.
   - **Solve Equation**: Display the "equals" gesture to solve the current arithmetic expression.

3. **Exit the Program:**
   - Press the `Esc` key to exit the application.

## Example Gestures 🤲

- **Numbers**:
  - **0**: All fingers closed.
  - **1**: Thumb up.
  - **2**: Thumb and index finger up.
  - **3**: Thumb, index, and middle fingers up.
  - **4**: Thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers up.
  - **5**: All fingers up.

- **Operators**:
  - **+**: Extend your index and middle fingers.
  - **-**: Extend your index finger only.
  - **\***: Extend your thumb and index finger (making an "L" shape).
  - **/**: Cross your index and middle fingers.

- **Click**: Thumb and index finger touching.
- **Equals**: Make a fist and then extend your index finger.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```
